Mr. Astro Junior 3D

## The project

Mr. Astro Junior is looking for his spaceship so he can go home.

Mr. Astro Junior appears near a portal, in a room, and must find the other exit portal.
To do this, he sometimes has to defeat enemies, and perhaps they have the key to the portal. But sometimes, he needs to find the key, or collect things in order to get the key, or the key is broken, and he has to gather its pieces.

The final portal leads to his spaceship, allowing him to finally go home.

## the motivation

[after the 2D version](https://milosfarkas.itch.io/urhajos-mr-kicsi), I'd like to create a 3D game 

## The plan

- [ ] player goes to the portal and that leads to the next room
- [ ] player should gather a key to open the portal
- [ ] player should search for the key among platform elements
- [ ] player should collect objects to open a chest what contains the key
